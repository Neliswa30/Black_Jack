# Blackjack Game 
üóíÔ∏è Hooray!!! 
Welcome to my Blackjack game project! This project aims to simulate a classic Blackjack game where you can play against the dealer(computer). Here's what you need to know:

## Game Rules:
1. Objective: Beat the dealer by getting a hand total closer to 21 than the dealer‚Äôs hand without exceeding 21.

2. Card Values:
- Numbered cards are worth their face value.
- Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are each worth 10 points.
- Ace can be worth either 1 or 11 points, whichever is more advantageous.

## Gameplay:
- You start with two cards and can choose to 'hit' (get another card) or 'stand' (keep your current hand).
- The dealer follows a set of rules, typically hitting until their hand reaches at least 17.
- If you exceed 21 points, you bust and lose the game.
Winning:
- If your total is closer to 21 than the dealer‚Äôs, you win.
- If the dealer busts or if you have a Blackjack (an Ace and a 10-point card), you win with a higher payout.

## Technologies Used:
1. Python 3.x
2. Object-Oriented Programming principles for game logic

## Installation:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/Neliswa30/Black_Jack.git
2. Navigate into the project directory.
cd Black_jJack
3. Run the Python script to start the game.
python blackjack.py

## Future Enhancements:
- Implementing a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more interactive experience.
- Adding multiplayer support.
- Incorporating advanced Blackjack strategies.
